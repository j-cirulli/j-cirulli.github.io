# Predicting College Quarterback Success in the NFL
#### By: Jared Cirulli

## Discussion
NFL Quarterbacks come in all shapes and sizes, and historically it has been a great challenge, and often a hinderence, to find a quarterback that can perform at the next level. This project looks at this challenge, and examines some relevant quarterback statistics and physical attributes to see how well quarterback success can be determined and what factors contribute the most to this success.

## Project Description
This project is broken into 3 core parts:
1. Data collection: 
Scraping data from websites to get draft information as well as professional and collegiate statistics and attributes
2. Analysis: 
Use graphical means as well as fit a multivariable regression line to determine how driven NFL success is by each statistic and characteristic
3. Exploration:
Take the regression line and apply it to this years upcoming draft class. Through this, we can determine the model's version of what the NFL draft big board should be, and how this class stacks up against historical distributions
